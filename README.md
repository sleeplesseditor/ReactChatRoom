# ReactChatRoom

A chat room app built using React and Chatkit, based on Per Harald Borgen's Scrimba [tutorial](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pbNpTv).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get this up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd ReactChatRoom
2) npm install
3) Set up a Chatkit account and instance with [Pusher](https://pusher.com/chatkit) and create a config.js file for tokenUrl and instanceLocator variables
4) npm start
